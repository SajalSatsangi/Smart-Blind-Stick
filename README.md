Smart Blind Stick along with Digispark to help a person to detect the object from a distance.
The smart stick system for assisting blind people . Visually impaired people use stick to find difficulties in detecting obstacles and danger in front of them during walking and to identify the world around .



# Materials Required:-

1.	Digispark
2.	Ultrasonic Sensor 
3.	Buzzer and LED .
4.	Push Button
5.	9V Battery.
6.	Stick.
7.	Other materials like : glue,tape etc........
 
 
# Working:-
Obstacle Detection : When an object is detected within 3 meter range of the stick, a buzzer rings. For this project, only a single Ultrasonic Sensor Module was used. Thus, it can detect obstacle within 15 degree sector of the sensor.
